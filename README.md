# APS-Condition-Monitoring
In this repository I will perform binary classification on several Air Pressure Systems performance data to determine if the system is at risk of failure. I also demonstrated the usage of shapely values in conjuction with spearman correlation and single linkage hierarchical clustering to perform feature selection. The final model results in just a 10K euro loss due to wrong predictions, this is a 93% loss reduction compared to the overly cautious approach of doing preventive maintenance on every single data point in the test set (results to a ~150k loss).
