# APS-Condition-Monitoring
In this repository I will perform binary classification on Air Pressure Systems (APS) performance data to determine if the system is at risk of failure. Air Pressure Systems play a big role in controlling the brakes and gear changes of very large vehicles (trucks and busses). Wherein, failing to predict the breakdown of the systems is not only costly, but also fatal to the driver and bystanders alike. 

Apart from this, I also demonstrated the usage of shapely values in conjuction with spearman correlation and single linkage hierarchical clustering to perform feature selection. The final model results in a loss (due to wrong predictions) of 10K euros which is a 93% loss reduction compared to the overly cautious approach of doing preventive maintenance on every single data point in the test set (results to a ~150k loss).
